Beginning Steps
===============

Upon opening the Level Editor you have the option to open an existing world/levelset or create one of your own.
For this Guide we will start fresh and create a new one.

Select `Create World` and enter a name and description for your new world. The description is optional so if you are unsure what to write, just skip it and select `OK`.

Now you can begin to create your first level.

Setting Up Your Level
=====================

You are now presented with a snowy background and a lot of empty space.
On the right you see the Tile Select, Object Select and your general tools and on the bottom you will find several means to edit the level sector.
