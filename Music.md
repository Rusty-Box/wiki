_This page aims to gather the types of themes each world should have/needs to feel complete!_

**General themes** are open to optional alternate track to allow for some variety in levels of the same theming.

**Specific themes** are set and do not require alternate track as they are used for very specfic level theme, like boss battles,
special levels (i.e. Crytsal Mine, Between Two Glaciers, Ancient Ruin), worldmap etc.

---

World 1 - Icy Island
--------------------

The music of Icy Island should properly represent Tux's homeland. A familiar and vivid winter wonderland.
Only the icy caves and underwater themes be a bit more calm and reserved for the most part, but still keep
a similar spirit overall. The castle and (potentially) the outpost being the only truely intense themes of
world 1 (the current airship_remix song has a fitting vibe for the outpost so it could be used as a reference point here)!

Crystal Mine's theme should be the most different as it represents Tux leaving the save and familiar -
preparing to leave his home towards the unknown to rescue his beloved friend! A mix worry but also determination.

World 2 - Rooted Forest
-----------------------

The music of Rooted Forest should focus more on the mystic and wonder of the brand new environment.
A place Tux has never seen before. Exciting but with a little bit of caution! The Granito themes
should be closer to the feel of Icy Island. A save and welcoming place inhabited by kind, yet curious
creatures bouncing around in a beautiful calm landscape.

The themes for night time and thunderstorms should feel much more intense due to the powerful lightning
strikes and bombademou from the Owls. A nice climactic end to the forest world, right before the hidden
underground outpost and dark tunnels, followed by the eventual Corrupted Forest segment!

### General Themes

- [ ] Surface level theme (ideally one for sunrise/-set, midday, night)
- [ ] Underground level theme

World 2.5 - Corrupted Forest
----------------------------

The music of the Corrupted Forest should reflect the emptiness and lifeless feel of the once bright and
vibrant forest - the uncertainty of what happened for the more "calm" and slow paced themes with the
faster paced themes focusing more on the destruction and horrifying attributes of the corruption.

Potentially some "twisted" remixes of normal forest themes or at least some slight references here and
there to connect them closer together.

### General Themes

- [ ] Surface level theme (one calm, one intense)
- [ ] Underground level theme
- [ ] Sky/Airborne level theme
- [ ] Underwater level theme

### Specific Themes

- [ ] Worldmap theme
- [ ] Castle level theme
- [ ] Corrupted Granito level theme
- [ ] Corrupted Granito Ruin level theme
- [ ] Thunderstorm level theme
- [ ] Ghost Tree boss theme
- [ ] (Theme for a forest level that at last is starting to heal from the Corruption cause by the Ghost Tree - hopeful vibe)
