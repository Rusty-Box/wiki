_This page aims to gather the types of themes each world should have/needs to feel complete!_

**General themes** are open to optional alternate track to allow for some variety in levels of the same theming.

**Specific themes** are set and do not require alternate track as they are used for very specfic level theme, like boss battles,
special levels (i.e. Crytsal Mine, Between Two Glaciers, Ancient Ruin), worldmap etc.

---

World 1 - Icy Island
--------------------

The music of Icy Island should properly represent Tux's homeland. A familiar and vivid winter wonderland.
Only the icy caves and underwater themes should be more calm and reserved for the most part, but still keep
a similar spirit overall. The castle and (potentially) the outpost themes being the only truly intense themes of
world 1 (the current `airship_remix.ogg` has a fitting vibe for the outpost so it could be used as a reference point here)!

Crystal Mine's theme should be the most different out of the musical pieces of world 1, as it represents Tux leaving the familiar
island - preparing to leave his home and traveling towards the unknown (Rooted Forest) to rescue his beloved friend! A mix worry
but also determination.

World 2 - Rooted Forest
-----------------------

The music of Rooted Forest should focus more on the mystique and beauty of the brand new environment.
A place Tux has never seen before. Exciting but with a little bit of caution! The Granito themes
should be closer to the feel of Icy Island, minus the Ruins theme. A save and welcoming place inhabited by kind, yet curious
creatures bouncing around in a beautiful calm landscape. The Granito ruins on the other hand are more mysterious and ominous
sounding in nature - abandoned

The themes for nighttime levels and thunderstorms should feel much more intense due to the powerful lightning
strikes and bombardment by the Owls. A nice climactic end to the forest world, right before the hidden
underground outpost and dark tunnels, ultimately followed by the Corrupted Forest!

World 2.5 - Corrupted Forest
----------------------------

The music of the Corrupted Forest should reflect the emptiness and lifelessness of the once bright and
vibrant forest - focusing more on the uncertainty of what happened for the more "calm", ominous and slow
paced themes, with the faster paced themes focusing more on the destruction and horrifying attributes of
the corruption.

Potentially some "twisted" remixes of normal forest themes or at least some slight references here and
there to connect them closer together. The Corrupted Granito themes going in a more somber direction as
the once welcoming and lively Granito are now nothing but a mindless husk, roaming the fully overtaken
and destroyed villages and ruins

For the final level of world 2 (likely named "Regrowth"), the theme should bare a more hopeful tone.
At last a moment of relief! The Ghost Tree has been destroyed and the forest slowly begins to recover.
However the damage left by the Corruption (e.g. broken terrain, ruined land) do remain as a reminder of
what happend. Grateful for Tux's help, Granito are helping Tux too, proceeding to carry him across the
ocean towards the 3rd world, Tropical Paradise!

### General Themes

- [ ] Surface level theme (one calm, one intense)
