**Rooted Forest** is the second world in SuperTux. It is a massive forest devided into three general segments. The first segment, the introduction area, serves to introduce the main feel of the forest's level design and its common enemy types. The second, the ruin area, takes great focus on the Granito and introduces more challening platforming. The third and last, the **Corrupted Forest**, is also this worlds subtheme.

The Corrupted Forest is a larger section of the forest overtaken by the corrupting Roots. Its levels are inspired by previous forest levels but with a more challenging twist. It also houses its own unique enemy types (such as Corrupted Granito and Root Sapling) along side corrupted versions of all forest specific enemy types, with the exception of Owl and Zeekling who do not appear here!

This world concludes with the repelling the corruption from the forest and carring on towards the next world, Tropical Paradise, with the aid of the Granito, carrying Tux across the ocean.

### General

Rooted Forest is an enormus forest land high up north from Tux's home. Compared to Icy Island the land huge and vibrant in colors. Deep within there live the speicies of Granito, kind and friendly rock creatures living in villages all across the forest. Tux arrives during a uneasy time for them as the forest is plagued by corrupted roots claiming more and more land as time goes on until it reaches Tux midway. The Corrupted Forest is but an empty husk of what beauti the part of land once had. All creatures that called that part of the forest their home got corrupted and overtaken by the corrupted roots becoming much more danegrous.
